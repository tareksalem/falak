# FALAK: Orbit-Driven Decentralized Container Execution Platform

...

## 🧩 Additional Design Considerations

### 🔁 Capsule Versioning & Rollback
- Support for versioned capsules and rollbacks.
- Rollbacks can use cached snapshots or fetch previous versions from the registry.

### 🔐 Security Model
- Capsule signing and node trust verification mechanisms.
- Option to define execution policies per capsule (e.g., trusted-only nodes).
- Snapshot access via token-secured distributed storage.

### 📦 Snapshot Distribution
- Capsules may reference container snapshots stored on:
  - Distributed object stores (e.g., S3, MinIO)
  - Peer-to-peer storage (e.g., IPFS)
  - Shared volume plugins for edge disks

### 📶 Latency-Aware Execution
- Latency metrics are considered in gravity.
- Capsules can prioritize nodes with consistent low-latency profiles.

### 🧬 Capsule Affinity Rules
- Capsules can define:
  - Required tags (must-have)
  - Preferred tags (e.g., region, GPU support)
  - Anti-affinity (avoid tags)

### 📊 Observability
- Capsule lifecycle tracing (orbit logs, election results).
- Dashboards for:
  - Active capsules per node
  - Orbit health visualization
  - Event bus diagnostics

### 🛰️ Capsule-to-Capsule Communication
- Orbit-based capsule discovery.
- Potential orbit-DNS pattern for capsule addressing.

### 💰 Cost & Node Economy
- Nodes can advertise resource cost per request.
- Gravity may include pricing factor for optimization.
- Possibility of future node bidding marketplace.

### 🧱 Stateful Workloads (Future)
- Integration of volume claims per capsule.
- Volume log syncing or orbit-attached persistent volumes.

### 🧲 Fallback Capsule Fetching
- Nodes can re-request capsule metadata via orbit rebroadcast.
- Pull directly from known snapshot/image registry if absent.

### 🧠 Orbit Rebalancing (Future Optimization)
- Adaptive orbits based on:
  - Access frequency
  - Client region
  - Resource trends
